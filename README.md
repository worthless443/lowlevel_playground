Objective
----------
Mixing C and Assembly, thinking if assembly functions are faster than C in runtime given a specific usecase of the code. Wrapping all syscalls to a C library to possibly simplify system library even more

### Key Notes 
* Discards the stack by pushing base pointer
* Is the stack global or local to functions

Great way to learn low level bits and bytes, registers and addresses, stack alignment etc.
